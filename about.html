                Coding class 24, is made up of 11 brilliant students from different Schools. 
                The class started on the 2nd day of August, 2024 and was led by Mr. Sam,
                who taught us how to write codes effectively. In Coding class 24, 
                we learnt how to make use of HTML and CSS to develop and design websites.
                The class held at Divino Amore Vocational Institute which is located at Okpuno,
                behind Flora Field Aacademy, Awka, Anambra State Nigeria.
                We had very interactive class sessions with laptops which helped us practicalize immediately what we were taught.
                In class, we used HTML tags and elements to create a website and CSS for designing it.
                The URL to the website we created is thus: _______.
                Due to shortage of programmers in Nigeria, 
                the institute took a bold step in organizing the coding class and for that, we appreciate them.
                One can be self employed with the knowledge of programming, and a field such as cybersecurity,
                can be of great help in the banking and finance sector.
                Finally, at the end of the day,
                we the students of coding class 24 were able to assimilate all that we were taught and this on the long run,
                will enable us become good programmers.

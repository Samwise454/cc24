						My name is Okoye Chimdalu Josephine,

						<h2>About My School</h2>

						The name of my school is Divine Intervention.
						It is coloured pink and  blue,
						It has about twenty-five teachers.
						It has twelve classrooms,
						It has surplus gardens,
						It has very beautifully coloured  flowers,
						It has beautifully coloured solar lights. 
						My school has surplus packets of white board Marker,
						and it has  very beautiful sourroundings that are very tantalizing, 
						my school  also has many facilities.<br>
						My school has a very captivating and inspiring slogan that is <b>"LIFE IS AN EXAMINATION"</b>
						the interpretation of my school slogan is:
						"Life is an examination many people fail it because they try to copy others not realizing that everyone has a different quetion paper.
						If a lion and a goat are proffessional hunters it dosen't mean that a lion can eat a yam and a goat can be a canivore,
						That a lion can't eat a yam and a goat can't be a canivore dosen't make the lion useless but have their own territorial capacity.
						If a flower smells better than a tomatoe dosen't mean that the flower can make a better stew.<br>
						If one wastes his or her time in copying from a person who is bent on destroying his or her life he or she is just wasting his 
						or her time . 
						My school also taught we the  students a write up about <b>"TIME"</b> which goes like this:
						"Time waits for no one, time stop for no one your indecision will not slow down time, your complainants will not delay time,
						so don't waste your time in anger, regrets, worries and hate because those you worry about might be where they are enjoying.
						My school Divine Intervention is a well motivated school, My school sees that every one is carried along no  matter the person's status and level of understanding.
						my school has a very strict exquisite slogan which is:"NEVER LOOK DOWN ON YOURSELF BECAUSE BROKEN CRAYON STILL COLOUR AND
						YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHAT GOD WANTS YOUR EXPECTED POSITION IN LIFE TO BE".
						Another exquisite thing about what she said is that "no man on earth give like God Almighty, WHY? Because humans give and take but
						God doesn't.
						So one has to be wise to overcome what one wants in life.
